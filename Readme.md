# Multimodal E-learning Recommender System

## Overview  
The **Multimodal E-learning Recommender System** is an innovative project designed to deliver dynamic and personalized course recommendations by leveraging **Neo4j graph databases** and advanced **machine learning algorithms**. This project represents relationships between entities such as courses, students, instructors, and skills to provide insightful and tailored recommendations.

## Features  
- **Graph-based Relationships**: Using Neo4j to model relationships between courses, instructors, categories, and skills.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes hybrid recommendation models to generate personalized course suggestions.  
- **Community Detection**: Implements the **Louvain algorithm** for detecting communities in the dataset.  
- **Python-Based Analysis**: Detailed course distribution insights using Python libraries.  

## Project Objectives  
1. Build a robust recommendation system for e-learning platforms.  
2. Utilize multimodal graphs for representing course and user interactions.  
3. Perform advanced data analysis to improve recommendation accuracy.
